# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project I devoloped an item-tracker to jelp the Corner Grocer to track their items throughout the day in order to enable the store to rearrange their produce section in the most efficent manner. 

# What did you do particularly well?
One thing done well is the OOP. The tracker class encapsulates the funcinality of the program well. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One thing that could be enhanced is added input validation, and to further modularize the code into seperate functions for each menu option. This would allow the code to be more easily updated and maintained. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenge I faced is when creating the loadData function due to having trouble finding the file with the CLion IDE.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
One Transferable skill is efficent use of data structures like maps, OOP and encapsulation. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One way I made this code maintainable readable and adaptible is organizing it with classes and functions. Furthermopre detailed comments helped.
